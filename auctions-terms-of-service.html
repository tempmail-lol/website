<h1>TempMail Auctions Terms of Service</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Agreement
        <ul>
            <li>You agree to abide and be bound by these Terms of Service. You acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you will not be able to use our services.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Privacy
        <ul>
            <li>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. The personal information you provide during the bidding process is used for service delivery purposes and for processing your payment.</li>
            <li>In order to process payments, we share necessary information with our payment processor, Stripe. We do not share your information with other third parties without your consent, except to comply with laws or to protect our rights. Please review Stripe's privacy policy (www.stripe.com) to understand how they manage your data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Bidding Process
        <ul>
            <li>To place a bid, you must provide: your bidding price and the domain you are bidding on.  Bids will be placed via email as listed on the auction page.</li>
            <li>You agree to accept bids at your placed price when the bidding process closes, and failure to pay results in an expired bid which is then not charged and not rewarded to you.</li>
            <li>Once a bid is placed, you may place higher bids, though no changes will be considered as to lower, previous prices; as previous, lower bids will become expired once a new, higher price is bid.</li>
            <li>If more than one bid is made per email address, only the highest bid will be considered.</li>
            <li>To bid on multiple domains if multiple domains are being auctioned, please send a separate email for each domain.</li>
            <li>If the highest bidder fails to pay after the date listed on the invoice in the UTC Timezone, the highest bidder’s bid and invoice will expire and will go to the next highest bid when the auction time expired, becoming the new highest bid. The new highest bidder’s price will then be made available to that bidder until the date listed on the invoice of the new highest bid invoice to pay for the domain. This process will be repeated no more than five (5) times, after which the domain may be put up for auction again, removed from sale, or otherwise disposed of at our discretion.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to extend the bidding process if all bidders fail to pay the invoice sent to them.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to stop the bidding process if all bidders fail to pay the invoice sent to them and decide how, when, and if the domain will be auctioned again.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Communication
        <ul>
            <li>You will be contacted via email if you are outbid or if you win the auction.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Payment and Transfer
        <ul>
            <li>Upon payment of the invoice, a domain key will be sent to the email address used to place your bid.</li>
            <li>The domain key will not be emailed until the invoice has been paid in full.</li>
            <li>All email addresses will be verified before the domain key is mailed. If the email address provided is not valid, the bid will be considered invalid, expire, and the domain will be sold to the next highest bidder.</li>
            <li>Due to registrar restrictions, you may not be able to transfer the domain to another registrar until 60 days after the transfer. Domain transfers may take up to 7 days to initiate.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Liability
        <ul>
            <li>We are not responsible for any issues or costs associated with the transfer of the domain to another registrar.</li>
            <li>Domain registrars may charge a fee to transfer the domain to another registrar. It is your responsibility to check your registrar's pricing and terms of service before bidding.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Changes to Terms of Service
        <ul>
