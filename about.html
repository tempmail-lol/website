        <h2>What is TempMail?</h2>
        TempMail, otherwise known as a disposable email generator, is a website which generates disposable
        email addresses to use on websites. A lot of websites which require you to sign up for an account to use
        certain features, require you to use an email address, and some of them require you to verify it.
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How does TempMail solve this problem?</h2>
        <p>
            By using a temporary email address, you can avoid email-based tracking.  If you use an email address
            specifically for accounts you don't care about, it is likely your real name has been associated with it,
            and that hackers could use that information to build a profile on you.
            Check <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a> to see if your email address was part of a
            data breach.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will release data in the near future if any of our domains are found in data breaches to
            measure the effectiveness of using a temporary email.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Can I use IMAP/POP/any other protocol to access the inbox?</h2>
        <p>
            No, our servers do not follow standard inbox protocols.  You can
            use <a href="https://tempmail.lol/news/2022/05/17/how-to-use-the-tempmail-api/">one of our libraries</a>
            to connect to the API.
            <br>
            This may be considered in a future release, but it is low priority.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Do you keep logs?</h2>
        Our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy policy</a> answers this.  Keep in mind that some websites will
        keep a record of the emails they send to their customers, and may include a tracking URL
        in their emails, which uniquely identifies your email to your computer.
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>What websites should I use this on?</h2>
        <p>
            We recommend you use TempMail on websites that you will not be using for more than a day.  These include
            websites that require you to create an account to download a video, or that require you to create an account
            to view certain content.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Do the email addresses expire?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes.  Your email address will expire after a limit of one hour.<br>
            If you are using the API, your email may expire after longer depending on the API tier you have.<br>
            <a href="/pricing">View the pricing page here</a>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Why are the names of the websites for emails strange?</h2>
        <p>
            This helps avoid websites blocking TempMail email addresses
            from being used, and signing up for a website with "temp email" in the link could trigger filters to block TempMail.<br>
            We will continue to add new domains periodically to make sure these lists don't block all of our domains.
