        <h2>What is TempMail?</h2>
        TempMail, otherwise known as a disposable email generator, is a website which generates disposable
        email addresses to use on websites. A lot of websites which require you to sign up for an account to use
        certain features, require you to use an email address, and some of them require you to verify it.
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How does TempMail solve this problem?</h2>
        <p>
            By using a temporary email address, you can avoid email-based tracking.  If you use an email address
            specifically for accounts you don't care about, it is likely your real name has been associated with it,
            and that hackers could use that information to build a profile on you.
            Check <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a> to see if your email address was part of a
            data breach.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will release data in the near future if any of our domains are found in data breaches to
            measure the effectiveness of using a temporary email.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Can I use IMAP/POP/any other protocol to access the inbox?</h2>
        <p>
            No, our servers do not follow standard inbox protocols.  You can
            use <a href="https://tempmail.lol/news/2022/05/17/how-to-use-the-tempmail-api/">one of our libraries</a>
            to connect to the API.
            <br>
            This may be considered in a future release, but it is low priority.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Do you keep logs?</h2>
        Our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy policy</a> answers this.  We do not connect
        inboxes to accounts, IP addresses, or user agents.  Keep in mind that most websites will
        keep a record of the emails they send to their customers, and may include a tracking URL
        in their emails, which uniquely identifies your email to your computer.
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>What websites should I use this on?</h2>
        <p>
            We recommend you use TempMail on websites that you will not be using for more than a day.  These include
            websites that require you to create an account to download a video, or that require you to create an account
            to view certain content.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Do the email addresses expire?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes.  Your email address will expire after a hard limit of one hour.<br>
            After that hour, the address will no longer receive emails.<br>
            Note that if you do not connect to our servers (as in not having the website open) within 10 minutes, your email will expire (soft limit).<br><br>
            If you have <a href="/pricing.html">TempMail Plus</a>, the hard limit is raised to <u>ten hours</u>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Why are the names of the websites for emails strange?</h2>
        <p>
            This helps avoid websites blocking TempMail email addresses
            from being used, and signing up for a website with "temp email" in the link could trigger filters to block TempMail.
